# 0.0

## Feature

- `khalorg new` is added. It converts an org agenda item into a `khal` agenda
  item.
- `khalorg list` is added. It converts a `khal` agenda item into an org agenda
  item.
- `khalorg edit` is added. It edits an existing `khal` agenda item with org
  mode.
- `khalorg delete` is added. It deletes an existing `khal` item.
- Recurring items are supported by providing an org repeater in the
  time stamp (e.g., `+1w`). The following is supported:
  - the follow org repeaters: `+{integer}{d,w,m,y}`
  - `khalorg new` and `khalorg edit --edit-dates` support 1 time stamp
    per org agenda item.
  - `khalorg list` concatenates timestamps that cannot be describes by
    an org repeater, resulting in an org agenda item with multiple
    timestamps.
  - Supports an `until` date for recurring items. The until date can be
    supplied through an org property `UNTIL`.

## Task

- An Office 365 workflow with a [bash script](./extras/calsync) is added which
  synchronizes all `vdirsyncer` calendars and exports them to org with `khalorg`.
  Davmail is used as the CalDav server.
